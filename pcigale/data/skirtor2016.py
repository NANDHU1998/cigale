        Parameters
        ----------
        t: float
            average edge-on optical depth at 9.7 micron; the actual one along
            the line of sight may vary depending on the clumps distribution
        pl: float
            power-law exponent that sets radial gradient of dust density
        q: float
            index that sets dust density gradient with polar angle
        oa: float
            angle measured between the equatorial plan and edge of the torus.
            Half-opening angle of the dust-free cone is 90-oa
        R: float
            ratio of outer to inner radius, R_out/R_in
        Mcl: float
            fraction of total dust mass inside clumps. 0.97 means 97% of total
            mass is inside the clumps and 3% in the interclump dust.
        i: float
            inclination, i.e. viewing angle, i.e. position of the instrument
            w.r.t. the AGN axis. i=0: face-on, type 1 view; i=90: edge-on, type
            2 view.
        norm: float
            normalization factor (integral of the dust luminosity).
        wave: array of float
            Wavelength grid in nm.
        disk: array of flaot
            Luminosity of the accretion disk in W/nm
        dust: array of float
            Luminosity of the dust in W/nm
